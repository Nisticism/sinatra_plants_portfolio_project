# Portfolio Plants Project!

For this project, the user should be able to create their own stock of plants for a shop that could be somewhere in real life.  

The user should have a secure password, be able to log in and log out, and add plants to his or her collection.

Install instructions: 

1) Run the app with shotgun or rackup config.ru in a terminal. 

2) Follow the local link, probably http://127.0.0.1:9393/ for shotgun or http://127.0.0.1:9292/ for rackup.

3) Sign up for a new account or login with an existing account.
